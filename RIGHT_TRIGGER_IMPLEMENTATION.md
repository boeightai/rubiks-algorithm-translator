# Right Trigger Pattern Highlighting Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds visual highlighting to algorithms that contain the "Right Trigger" pattern (R U R' U') within longer algorithms. This helps users identify and memorize common sub-patterns that appear in multiple algorithms.

## What is the Right Trigger?

The Right Trigger is a fundamental 4-move sequence: **R U R' U'**

- **R**: Right face clockwise
- **U**: Up face clockwise  
- **R'**: Right face counterclockwise
- **U'**: Up face counterclockwise

This pattern is also known as the "Sexy Move" and appears in many algorithms across different categories.

**Important Note**: Lowercase "r" moves (right slice moves) are NOT part of the Right Trigger pattern and are not highlighted. The Right Trigger only includes uppercase "R" moves.

## Implementation Details

### Pattern Detection

The system detects only the standard Right Trigger pattern:
- `R U R' U'` - Standard Right Trigger (uppercase R only)

**Excluded patterns** (these are different moves and not Right Triggers):
- `r U R' U'` - Contains lowercase r (right slice move)
- `R U r' U'` - Contains lowercase r' (right slice move)
- `r U r' U'` - Contains lowercase r moves (right slice moves)

### Visual Highlighting

When a Right Trigger pattern is detected in an algorithm, the following visual cues are applied:

1. **Move Numbers**: Highlighted with green background and border
2. **Move Images**: 
   - Green border and background
   - Slightly larger scale (1.05x)
   - Enhanced shadow
3. **Move Labels**: Green text color
4. **Target Indicator**: Small green circle with ðŸŽ¯ emoji in top-right corner
5. **Header Badge**: "Right Trigger" indicator badge appears in the header

### Examples of Algorithms with Right Trigger

The following algorithms contain Right Trigger patterns:

1. **Right Hand Algorithm** (R U R' U') - The pattern itself
2. **OLL Line** (F R U R' U' R U R' U' F') - Contains two Right Triggers
3. **OLL Dot** (F R U R' U' F' f R U R' U' f') - Contains two Right Triggers
4. **Beginner OLL Cross** (F R U R' U' F') - Contains one Right Trigger
5. **OLL T-Shape** (R U R' U' R' F R F') - Contains one Right Trigger

### Examples of Algorithms WITHOUT Right Trigger

The following algorithms do NOT contain Right Trigger patterns (and will not be highlighted):

1. **OLL Case 24 - Chameleon** (r U R' U' r' F R F') - Contains lowercase r moves, not Right Trigger
2. **OLL Case 25 - Cross** (F' r U R' U' r' F R) - Contains lowercase r moves, not Right Trigger

## Benefits for Users

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Users can quickly identify familiar sub-patterns in longer algorithms
2. **Memorization Aid**: Breaking down complex algorithms into recognizable chunks
3. **Learning Efficiency**: Understanding that many algorithms are built from common building blocks
4. **Confidence Building**: Recognizing familiar patterns reduces the intimidation of longer algorithms
5. **Accurate Learning**: Only highlighting true Right Trigger patterns, not similar-looking but different moves

## Technical Implementation

The highlighting is implemented in `src/VisualSequence.jsx`:

- `detectRightTriggerPatterns()` function identifies only standard Right Trigger patterns
- Visual styling applied conditionally based on pattern detection
- No changes to existing functionality - only adds visual enhancements
- Responsive design maintained across different screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:

1. **Left Trigger Detection**: Highlight L' U' L U patterns
2. **Sledgehammer Detection**: Highlight R' F R F' patterns
3. **Custom Pattern Detection**: Allow users to define their own patterns
4. **Pattern Statistics**: Show how often patterns appear across all algorithms
5. **Learning Progress**: Track which patterns users have mastered

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with various algorithm types:
- âœ… Standard Right Trigger (R U R' U')
- âœ… Multiple Right Triggers in one algorithm
- âœ… Algorithms with lowercase r moves (correctly NOT highlighted)
- âœ… Algorithms without Right Trigger patterns
- âœ… Edge cases and boundary conditions

All tests pass successfully, confirming accurate pattern detection and highlighting.

## Bug Fixes

**Fixed Issue**: Initially included lowercase "r" variations in Right Trigger detection. This was incorrect because:
- Lowercase "r" moves the right slice (middle layer), not the right face
- Right Trigger specifically refers to right face moves (uppercase "R")
- Including lowercase "r" would mislead users about what constitutes a Right Trigger

The fix ensures only true Right Trigger patterns (with uppercase "R") are highlighted.
