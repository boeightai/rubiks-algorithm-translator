# Left Trigger Pattern Highlighting Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds visual highlighting to algorithms that contain the "Left Trigger" pattern (L' U' L U) within longer algorithms. This helps users identify and memorize common sub-patterns that appear in multiple algorithms, complementing the existing Right Trigger highlighting feature.

## What is the Left Trigger?

The Left Trigger is a fundamental 4-move sequence: **L' U' L U**

- **L'**: Left face counterclockwise
- **U'**: Up face counterclockwise  
- **L**: Left face clockwise
- **U**: Up face clockwise

This pattern is the mirror image of the Right Trigger and appears in many algorithms across different categories.

**Important Note**: Lowercase "l" moves (left slice moves) are NOT part of the Left Trigger pattern and are not highlighted. The Left Trigger only includes uppercase "L" moves.

## Implementation Details

### Pattern Detection

The system detects only the standard Left Trigger pattern:
- `L' U' L U` - Standard Left Trigger (uppercase L only)

**Excluded patterns** (these are different moves and not Left Triggers):
- `l' U' L U` - Contains lowercase l' (left slice move)
- `L' U' l U` - Contains lowercase l (left slice move)
- `l' U' l U` - Contains lowercase l moves (left slice moves)

### Visual Highlighting

When a Left Trigger pattern is detected in an algorithm, the following visual cues are applied:

1. **Move Numbers**: Highlighted with blue background and border
2. **Move Images**: 
   - Blue border and background
   - Slightly larger scale (1.05x)
   - Enhanced shadow
3. **Move Labels**: Blue text color
4. **Target Indicator**: Small blue circle with ðŸŽ¯ emoji in top-left corner
5. **Header Badge**: "Left Trigger" indicator badge appears in the header

### Color Scheme

- **Right Trigger**: Green color scheme (success colors)
- **Left Trigger**: Blue color scheme (info colors)

This color differentiation helps users distinguish between the two trigger patterns when both appear in the same algorithm.

### Examples of Algorithms with Left Trigger

The following algorithms contain Left Trigger patterns:

1. **Left Hand Algorithm** (L' U' L U) - The pattern itself
2. **OLL Line** (F' L' U' L U F) - Contains one Left Trigger
3. **OLL Dot** (F' L' U' L U F f' L' U' L U f) - Contains two Left Triggers
4. **Beginner OLL Cross** (F' L' U' L U F) - Contains one Left Trigger
5. **OLL T-Shape** (F' L' U' L U F) - Contains one Left Trigger

### Examples of Algorithms WITHOUT Left Trigger

The following algorithms do NOT contain Left Trigger patterns (and will not be highlighted):

1. **OLL Case 24 - Chameleon** (r U R' U' r' F R F') - Contains lowercase r moves, not Left Trigger
2. **OLL Case 25 - Cross** (F' r U R' U' r' F R) - Contains lowercase r moves, not Left Trigger

## Benefits for Users

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Users can quickly identify familiar sub-patterns in longer algorithms
2. **Memorization Aid**: Breaking down complex algorithms into recognizable chunks
3. **Learning Efficiency**: Understanding that many algorithms are built from common building blocks
4. **Confidence Building**: Recognizing familiar patterns reduces the intimidation of longer algorithms
5. **Accurate Learning**: Only highlighting true Left Trigger patterns, not similar-looking but different moves
6. **Mirror Pattern Understanding**: Helps users understand the relationship between Right and Left Triggers

## Technical Implementation

The highlighting is implemented in `src/VisualSequence.jsx`:

- `detectLeftTriggerPatterns()` function identifies only standard Left Trigger patterns
- Visual styling applied conditionally based on pattern detection
- Uses blue color scheme (info colors) to differentiate from Right Trigger (green)
- Handles overlapping patterns gracefully with neutral color scheme
- No changes to existing functionality - only adds visual enhancements
- Responsive design maintained across different screen sizes

### Overlapping Pattern Handling

When both Right Trigger and Left Trigger patterns are detected in the same algorithm:
- Overlapping moves use neutral colors (gray) to avoid confusion
- Header shows "Both Triggers" indicator instead of separate badges
- Visual indicators use neutral color for overlapping patterns
- Border styling gracefully handles pattern intersections

## Integration with Right Trigger

The implementation works alongside the existing Right Trigger highlighting:

- Both patterns can be detected in the same algorithm
- Different color schemes prevent confusion
- Header shows badges for both patterns when present
- Visual indicators are positioned differently (Right Trigger: top-right, Left Trigger: top-left)

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:

1. **Sledgehammer Detection**: Highlight R' F R F' patterns
2. **Custom Pattern Detection**: Allow users to define their own patterns
3. **Pattern Statistics**: Show how often patterns appear across all algorithms
4. **Learning Progress**: Track which patterns users have mastered
5. **Pattern Comparison**: Show side-by-side comparison of Right vs Left Triggers

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with various algorithm types:
- âœ… Standard Left Trigger (L' U' L U)
- âœ… Multiple Left Triggers in one algorithm
- âœ… Algorithms with lowercase l moves (correctly NOT highlighted)
- âœ… Algorithms without Left Trigger patterns
- âœ… Algorithms with both Right and Left Triggers
- âœ… Edge cases and boundary conditions

All tests pass successfully, confirming accurate pattern detection and highlighting.

## Bug Fixes

**Fixed Issue**: Initially included lowercase "l" variations in Left Trigger detection. This was incorrect because:
- Lowercase "l" moves the left slice (middle layer), not the left face
- Left Trigger specifically refers to left face moves (uppercase "L")
- Including lowercase "l" would mislead users about what constitutes a Left Trigger

The fix ensures only true Left Trigger patterns (with uppercase "L") are highlighted.

## Color System

The implementation uses the following color scheme for Left Trigger:

- **Background**: `colors.info[50]` (light blue)
- **Borders**: `colors.info[300]` (medium blue)
- **Text**: `colors.info[700]` (dark blue)
- **Indicators**: `colors.info[500]` (standard blue)

This provides good contrast and accessibility while maintaining visual consistency with the design system.
