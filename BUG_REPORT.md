# Bug Report - Rubik's Cube Algorithm Translator

## Executive Summary
The codebase has been thoroughly analyzed for bugs and critical issues. **No critical bugs were found**, and the application is in good condition. One minor issue was identified and fixed during the analysis.

## Issues Found and Resolved

### âœ… FIXED: Missing Import in AlgorithmDetails.jsx
**Severity:** Low  
**Status:** Resolved  
**Location:** `src/components/AlgorithmDetails.jsx`

**Issue:** The `shadows` object was being used but not imported from the design system.
```javascript
// Before (lines 66, 294)
boxShadow: shadows.md,

// After
import { colors, spacing, typography, borderRadius, transitions, shadows } from '../styles/designSystem'
```
