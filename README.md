# Rubik's Cube Algorithm Translator

A modern web application for learning and practicing Rubik's Cube algorithms with visual notation translation. Convert algorithm notation to step-by-step visual move sequences for those that struggle to learn and internalize the traditional notation system used in speedcubing communities.

## 🚀 Features

- **Tutorial Mode**: Interactive carousel with 8 fundamental algorithms
- **Visual Sequence**: Step-by-step visual representation of cube moves
- **Mobile Optimized**: Responsive design with touch-friendly controls
- **Offline Support**: Progressive Web App (PWA) with service worker
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Search & Filter**: Find algorithms by category, difficulty, and favorites
- **Visual Learning**: Move-by-move visual sequences with move images

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS with design system
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **PWA**: Service Worker for offline functionality
- **Analytics**: Vercel Analytics integration

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd rubiks-translator

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Important: Cache Refresh for Updates

To ensure users always get the latest version without needing a hard refresh:

```bash
# Before each deployment, update the service worker version
npm run update-version

# Then build the application
npm run build

# Deploy as usual
```

This process ensures:
- Automatic detection of new versions
- Immediate activation of updates (no waiting)
- Automatic page reload when updates are available
- No manual browser refresh required by users

### Vercel Deployment

1. **Connect Repository**: Link your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. **Build Settings**: 
   - Build Command: `npm run update-version && npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`
3. **Environment Variables**: No additional environment variables required
4. **Deploy**: Vercel will automatically deploy on push to main branch

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Update service worker version for cache refresh
npm run update-version

# Build the application
npm run build

# The dist folder contains the production build
# Deploy the contents of dist/ to your web server
```

## 📱 PWA Features

- **Offline Support**: Service worker caches critical resources
- **App Installation**: Users can install as a native app
- **Background Sync**: Handles offline data synchronization
- **Push Notifications**: Ready for future notification features

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

No environment variables are required for basic functionality.

### Build Configuration
