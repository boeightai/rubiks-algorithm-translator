# Rubik's Cube Algorithm Translator

A modern React application for learning and practicing Rubik's Cube algorithms with visual notation translation. The app translates standard cube notation (like "R U R' U'") into visual move sequences using custom move images.

**üåê Live Application**: [www.wayofthecube.com](https://www.wayofthecube.com)

## üë®‚Äçüëß Our Story

This project was born from a shared passion between father and daughter - **Bo and Hailey's** love for solving Rubik's cubes and learning to code together. We created this application because we found the standard Rubik's cube notation system challenging to memorize, so we developed a custom visual notation system that makes learning algorithms more intuitive and accessible for beginners and advanced cubers alike.

This project serves dual purposes: it helps cubers master algorithms through our visual system, while also serving as our coding learning journey. We're exploring modern development tools like Cursor and Claude Code, making this a perfect blend of our interests.

## ü§ù Community & Future Vision

We're excited to share our work with the broader community and welcome contributions from both the **programming community** and the **Rubik's cube community**! Whether you're a developer who wants to help improve the codebase or a cuber who wants to suggest new features or algorithms, we'd love to hear from you.

Our longer-term vision is to keep creating and adding more features, with the goal of one day developing this into a **freemium business model**. We plan to offer premium features while ensuring that beginners can always access our visual notational system and core learning tools for free. This way, we can support the community while building something sustainable.

**We believe in making Rubik's cube learning accessible to everyone!** üß©

## üß© Rubik's Cube Notation System

### Standard Notation Conventions

The application uses the **WCA (World Cube Association) standard notation** for Rubik's Cube moves. This notation system is universally recognized by speedcubers and is essential for understanding algorithm documentation.

#### Basic Face Moves
- **R** = Right face clockwise (90¬∞)
- **R'** = Right face counter-clockwise (90¬∞) - Note: The apostrophe (') indicates "Prime" or inverse
- **R2** = Right face 180¬∞ rotation
- **L** = Left face clockwise (90¬∞)
- **L'** = Left face counter-clockwise (90¬∞)
- **L2** = Left face 180¬∞ rotation
- **U** = Up face clockwise (90¬∞)
- **U'** = Up face counter-clockwise (90¬∞)
- **U2** = Up face 180¬∞ rotation
- **D** = Down face clockwise (90¬∞)
- **D'** = Down face counter-clockwise (90¬∞)
- **D2** = Down face 180¬∞ rotation
- **F** = Front face clockwise (90¬∞)
- **F'** = Front face counter-clockwise (90¬∞)
- **F2** = Front face 180¬∞ rotation
- **B** = Back face clockwise (90¬∞) - Note: B moves are less common in algorithms

#### Wide Moves (Slice Moves)
- **Rw** = Right wide move (R + M slice together)
- **Rw'** = Right wide move counter-clockwise
- **Rw2** = Right wide move 180¬∞
- **Lw** = Left wide move (L + M slice together)
- **Lw'** = Left wide move counter-clockwise
- **Lw2** = Left wide move 180¬∞
- **Uw** = Up wide move (U + E slice together)
- **Uw'** = Up wide move counter-clockwise
- **Uw2** = Up wide move 180¬∞
- **Dw** = Down wide move (D + E slice together)
- **Dw'** = Down wide move counter-clockwise
- **Dw2** = Down wide move 180¬∞
- **Fw** = Front wide move (F + S slice together)
- **Fw'** = Front wide move counter-clockwise
- **Fw2** = Front wide move 180¬∞

#### Middle Layer Moves
- **M** = Middle slice (between L and R faces) in the same direction as L
- **M'** = Middle slice counter-clockwise
- **M2** = Middle slice 180¬∞

#### Lowercase Notation Conversion
The application automatically converts lowercase notation to wide moves for clarity:
- **r** ‚Üí **Rw** (Right wide move)
- **r'** ‚Üí **Rw'** (Right wide move prime)
- **r2** ‚Üí **Rw2** (Right wide move 180¬∞)
- **l** ‚Üí **Lw** (Left wide move)
- **l'** ‚Üí **Lw'** (Left wide move prime)
- **l2** ‚Üí **Lw2** (Left wide move 180¬∞)
- **u** ‚Üí **Uw** (Up wide move)
- **u'** ‚Üí **Uw'** (Up wide move prime)
- **u2** ‚Üí **Uw2** (Up wide move 180¬∞)
- **d** ‚Üí **Dw** (Down wide move)
- **d'** ‚Üí **Dw'** (Down wide move prime)
- **d2** ‚Üí **Dw2** (Down wide move 180¬∞)
- **f** ‚Üí **Fw** (Front wide move)
- **f'** ‚Üí **Fw'** (Front wide move prime)
- **f2** ‚Üí **Fw2** (Front wide move 180¬∞)

### Algorithm Categories and Examples

### Pattern Recognition System

The application automatically detects and highlights common algorithm patterns:

#### Right Trigger Pattern: `R U R' U'`

2. **Move Validation**: Each move is checked against the moves.json mapping
3. **Visual Translation**: Each move is converted to its corresponding image
4. **Pattern Detection**: Right and Left Trigger patterns are identified and highlighted
5. **Fallback Handling**: Missing moves display as text with warning styling

### Algorithm Database Structure

The application contains **126 algorithms** across multiple categories:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-identifier",
  "name": "Algorithm Name",
  "notation": "R U R' U'",
  "category": "Beginner Corners",
