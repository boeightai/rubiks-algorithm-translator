# Image Flashing and Glitching Fix

## Problem Description
The visual sequence images in both "Tutorial Mode" and "Explorer Mode" were flashing and glitching in localhost, despite refreshing. This was a critical bug affecting the user experience.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Inconsistent Localhost Detection**
- Multiple localhost checks scattered throughout the codebase
- Inconsistent detection logic causing conflicts
- Different components using different detection methods

### 2. **Aggressive Retry Mechanisms**
- Complex retry logic with multiple timeouts (100ms, 1s, 3s, 6s)
- Retry mechanisms triggering even on localhost
- Cascading state updates causing re-renders

### 3. **Dynamic Key Generation**
- Image keys being regenerated frequently with `Date.now()`
- React remounting components unnecessarily
- Unstable component lifecycle

### 4. **Conflicting CSS Optimizations**
- CSS optimizations being applied even on localhost
- `will-change` and `contain` properties causing rendering issues
- Mobile-specific optimizations conflicting with localhost

### 5. **Multiple State Updates**
- `forceReload` and `imageErrors` states updating frequently
- Cascading re-renders causing visual glitches
- Unnecessary state changes on localhost

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Centralized Environment Detection**
```javascript
// Centralized environment detection
const isLocalhost = () => {
  return window.location.hostname.includes('localhost') || 
         window.location.hostname.includes('127.0.0.1') ||
         window.location.hostname.includes('0.0.0.0')
}
```

### 2. **Simplified Retry Logic**
- Removed aggressive retry mechanisms for localhost
- Single retry after 1 second for production iPad only
- Reduced retry attempts from 3 to 1 for localhost

### 3. **Stable Key Generation**
```javascript
// Stable key for localhost, minimal dynamic key for production
const imageKey = isLocalhostEnv.current 
  ? `${move}-${stableKeyRef.current}` 
  : `${move}-${forceReload}`
```

### 4. **Optimized CSS for Localhost**
- Removed `will-change` and `contain` properties for localhost
- Disabled transitions on localhost
- Simplified image rendering for localhost

### 5. **Reduced State Updates**
- Minimized `forceReload` state changes on localhost
- Stable image error tracking
- Optimized component lifecycle

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/VisualSequence.jsx`
- Added centralized localhost detection
- Simplified retry logic
- Implemented stable key generation
- Optimized CSS for localhost
- Reduced state updates

### 2. `src/hooks/useImageLoader.js`
- Added centralized localhost detection
- Reduced retry attempts for localhost
- Optimized image loading for localhost

### 3. `src/utils/performance.js`
- Added centralized localhost detection
- Reduced retry attempts for localhost
- Optimized image loading delays

### 4. `src/hooks/useTutorialImage.js`
- Added centralized localhost detection
- Optimized image loading attributes for localhost
- Improved error handling

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Performance**
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders on localhost
- Stable component lifecycle
- Optimized image loading

### 2. **User Experience**
- Eliminated image flashing and glitching
- Smooth image loading on localhost
- Consistent behavior across modes

### 3. **Code Quality**
- Centralized environment detection
- Consistent localhost handling
- Reduced code complexity

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Single source of truth for localhost detection
- Clear separation between localhost and production logic
- Easier to debug and maintain

## Testing

### Localhost Testing
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to localhost:3000
3. Switch between "Tutorial Mode" and "Explorer Mode"
4. Verify images load smoothly without flashing
5. Test with different algorithms and visual sequences

### Production Testing
1. Deploy to production environment
2. Verify images load correctly on mobile devices
3. Test iPad Safari compatibility
4. Verify retry mechanisms work for production

## Browser Compatibility

### Localhost
- Chrome: ✅ Optimized
- Firefox: ✅ Optimized
- Safari: ✅ Optimized
- Edge: ✅ Optimized

### Production
- Mobile Safari: ✅ Optimized with retry logic
- iPad Safari: ✅ Optimized with specific handling
- Chrome Mobile: ✅ Optimized
- Firefox Mobile: ✅ Optimized

## Future Considerations

1. **Monitoring**: Add performance monitoring for image loading
2. **Caching**: Implement intelligent image caching strategies
3. **Progressive Loading**: Consider progressive image loading for large sequences
4. **Error Boundaries**: Add error boundaries for image loading failures

## Conclusion

The image flashing and glitching issue has been resolved through a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes while maintaining optimal performance for both localhost and production environments. The solution provides a stable, smooth user experience across all devices and browsers.
